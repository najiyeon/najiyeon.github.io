        #### Manipulate the camera with mouse movement

        > 1. **Orbit**: Rotate the camera around the target point by changing azimuth / elevation angles. (MMB (mouse middle button) in Blender)
        2. **Pan**: Move both the target point and camera in left, right, up and down direction of the camera. (Shift-MMB in Blender)
        3. **Zoom**: Move the camera forward toward the target point (zoom in) and backward away from the target point. (zoom out) (Ctrl-MMB in Blender)
        4. Toggle **perspective projection / orthogonal projection** by pressing ‘v’ key.
        5. Draw a **rectangular grid** with lines (not polygons) on xz plane as a reference ground plane. (like Blender)

        ## [Project 02 : Obj viewer & drawing a hierarchical model](https://github.com/najiyeon/CSE4020_Computer_Graphics/blob/main/project2/main.py)

        #### Implement my own obj file viewer 
        
        _1) showing a single loaded obj mesh and  2) showing an animation of a hierarchical model consisting of loaded obj meshes. The multiple light sources should be used for rendering._

        > **1. Single mesh rendering mode**
          - Open an obj file by drag-and-drop to your obj viewer window.
          - Read the obj file and display the mesh only using vertex positions, vertex normals, faces information.
          - When open an obj file, print out the following information of the obj file to stdout. (terminal)
        
        > **2. Animating hierarchical model rendering mode**
          - When a user presses a key ‘h’ on your viewer, your program should run in “animating hierarchical model rendering mode”.
          - The model should consist of at least 3 different meshes loaded from 3 different downloaded obj files.
          - The model should have a hierarchy of 3 levels and each node (except leaf nodes) should have at least 2 child nodes.
          - Animate the model to show the hierarchical structure.

        > **3. Lighting & Etc**
          - Render all object using Phong Illumination and Phong shading.
          - Toggle wireframe / solid mode by pressing ‘z’ key. (similar to pressing ‘z’ key in Blender)

        ### Paragraphs

        #### Paragraph

        **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks

        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
